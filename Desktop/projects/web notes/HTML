<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

Images
<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:

Show one picture if the browser window (viewport) is a minimum of 650 pixels, and another image if not, but larger than 465 pixels.

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_pink_flowers.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_white_flower.jpg">
  <img src="img_orange_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width:auto;">
</picture>
Background Image
<body style="background-image:url('clouds.jpg')">
<map> tag

An HTML table is defined with the <table> tag.

Each table row is defined with the <tr> tag. A table header is defined with the <th> tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the <td> tag.

table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
colspan and rowspan
To add a caption to a table, use the <caption> tag:


table#t01 tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #eee;
}
table#t01 tr:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: #fff;
}
table#t01 th {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
}


Lists
Unordered HTML List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:
disc	Sets the list item marker to a bullet (default)
circle	Sets the list item marker to a circle
square	Sets the list item marker to a square
none	The list items will not be marked

Ordered HTML List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default:
type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
type="i"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers

HTML Description Lists
HTML also supports description lists.

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

Lists can be nested inside lists
List items can contain other HTML elements
Use the CSS property float:left or display:inline to display a list horizontally

Blocks
Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

<div>	Defines a section in a document (block-level)
<span>	Defines a section in a document (inline)

Using The class Attribute
The class attribute specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.

The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name.

In CSS, to select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class:

ID
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).
In CSS, to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element:

Difference Between Class and ID
An HTML element can only have one unique id that belongs to that single element, while a class name can be used by multiple elements:

IFRAMES
An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
<iframe src="URL"></iframe>

<iframe height="300px" width="100%" src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a"></iframe>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a></p>
When the target of a link matches the name of an iframe, the link will open in the iframe.

HTML JavaScript
The <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

To select an HTML element, JavaScript very often uses the document.getElementById() method.
The <noscript> tag is used to provide an alternate content for users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesnt support client-side scripts: 

File paths
Absolute File Paths
An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file:
Example
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

Relative File Paths
A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.
In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:
Example
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

It is best practice to use relative file paths

HTML HEAD.
The following tags describe metadata: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

The HTML <title> Element
The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents.

The HTML <style> Element
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:

The HTML <link> Element
The <link> element is used to link to external style sheets:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

The HTML <meta> Element
The <meta> element is used to specify which character set is used, page description, keywords, author, and other metadata.
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
Define the character set used:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
Define a description of your web page:
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
Define keywords for search engines:
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript">
Define the author of a page:
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
Refresh document every 30 seconds:
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

Setting The Viewport
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

The HTML <script> Element
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.

The HTML <base> Element
The <base> element specifies the base URL and base target for all relative URLs in a page:

HTML Layouts
HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:

HTML tables (not recommended)
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS framework

HTML Responsive Web Design
Responsive Images
Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.
Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:
Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be use the max-width property instead.

Using the max-width Property
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:


Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width
The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes.
Resize the browser window to see how the image below change depending on the width:

Responsive Text Size
The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:
<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>


HTML Computer Code Elements
Computer Code <code>
HTML <kbd> For Keyboard Input
HTML <samp> For Program Output
he HTML <var> element defines a variable.

	non-breaking space	&nbsp;	&#160;
<	less than	&lt;	&#60;
>	greater than	&gt;	&#62;
&	ampersand	&amp;	&#38;
"	double quotation mark	&quot;	&#34;
'	single quotation mark (apostrophe)	&apos;	&#39;

 ̀	a	a&#768;	à

 HTML Symbol Entities

 URL - Uniform Resource Locator

 scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename
 scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)

The Most Important Differences from HTML:
Document Structure
XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
XHTML Elements
XHTML elements must be properly nested
XHTML elements must always be closed
XHTML elements must be in lowercase
XHTML documents must have one root element
XHTML Attributes
Attribute names must be in lower case
Attribute values must be quoted
Attribute minimization is forbidden
